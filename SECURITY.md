## Reporting a Vulnerability

Termbackup takes security very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT file a public issue. Instead, send an email directly to the project maintainer. 

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and strive to send you regular updates about our progress.
